Readme file for DiffStat.

This program is a simple filter that reads the output of the 'diff' program,
and produces a histogram of the total number of lines that were changed.  It is
useful for scanning a patch file to see which files were changed.

This is a reposting of the program to consolidate the patches over the past
year, and to use autoconf 2.12(971122).
