.SH NAME
\fBdiffstat\fP \- make histogram from diff-output
..
.SH USAGE
\fBdiffstat\fI [options] [file-specifications]
..
.SH SYNOPSIS
This program reads the output of \fBdiff\fP and displays a histogram
of the insertions, deletions, and modifications per-file.
..
.SH DESCRIPTION
Diffstat is a program that is useful for reviewing large, complex patch files.
It reads from one or more input files which contain output from \fBdiff\fP,
producing a histogram of the total lines changed for each file referenced.
..
.PP
Diffstat recognizes the most popular types of output from diff:
..
.RS
.TP
unified
preferred by the \fBpatch\fP utility.
..
.TP
context
best for readability, but not very compact.
..
.TP
default
not good for much, but simple to generate.
.RE
..
.PP
\fBDiffstat\fP detects the lines that are output by \fBdiff\fP to
tell which files are compared, and then counts the markers in the
first column that denote the type of change (insertion, deletion
or modification).
These are shown in the histogram as "+", "-" and "!" characters.
..
.PP
If no filename is given on the command line,
\fBdiffstat\fP reads the differences from the standard input.
..
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-n " number"
specify the minimum width used for filenames.
If you don't specify this, \fBdiffstat\fP uses the length of the longest
filename, after stripping common prefixes.
.TP
.BI \-p " number"
override the logic that strips common pathnames, simulating the \fBpatch\fP
"-p" option.
.TP
.B \-V
prints the current version number
.TP
.BI \-w " number"
specify the maximum width of the histogram.
The plot will never be shorter than 10 columns, just in case
the filenames get too large.
..
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
\fBDiffstat\fP runs in a portable UNIX\*R environment.
.SH FILES
.PP
\fBDiffstat\fP is a single binary module, which uses no auxiliary files.
..
.SH BUGS
.PP
\fBDiffstat\fP makes a lot of assumptions about the format of a \fBdiff\fP file.
.PP
There's no easy way to determine the degree of overlap between the
"before" and "after" displays of modified lines.
..
